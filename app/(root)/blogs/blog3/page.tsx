  <h2>First Impressions Drive Conversions</h2>
  <p>According to research, 94% of first impressions about a business are design-related. That means nearly every visitor judges your credibility and professionalism based on how your website looks and feels within 0.05 seconds.</p>
  <p>A poorly designed website can make even the best business look unreliable, causing potential customers to leave before they even learn what you offer. On the other hand, a professional design that's visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive can boost conversion rates by up to 200%.</p>
